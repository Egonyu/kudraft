Millions of Muslims and Christians are neighbors, and they agree that they worship the one and only God. Yet they seldom witness to each other, and the issues they deal with are profound. Rather than an antagonistic interaction, Badru D. Kateregga and David W. Shenk pioneer another way--that of authentic dialogue between friends.

                                        <p>The purpose of the study was to assess poultry firms’ survival and investigate possible strategies to improving survival of Biyinzika Enterprises Limited (BEL). The study thought to examine the current survival, challenges affecting BEL and establish the possible strategies of improving survivability of Biyinzika Enterprises Limited. The study was carried using a case study design using both qualitative and quantitative approaches of data collection; the Krejcie Morgan (1970) table of sample size determination was used to determine a sample size of 30 employees as the key informants of BEL’s departments. Data analysis was done using the Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS) to run descriptive statistics from which interpretations were made thereafter.</p>
                                        <p> The results showed that the current performance of BEL was good influenced by appropriate marketing strategies, team work, and good quality of poultry breeds, excellent quality customer service as well as qualified and experienced employees. Findings reveal that the challenges affecting BEL’s performance included; unreliable rainfall and drought, unstable and unreliable power supply, high costs of input, theft issues, unstable commodity prices and employee turnover. Basing on the results from the study, it was recommended that BEL should establish and strengthen her internal controls over cash and other financial resources, introduce reward systems, use solar energy system and plant drought resistant crops varieties. <hr>

                                        <p>The study focused on the factors influencing the place of delivery among mothers in Heliwa District in Somalia as the case study. The study objectively thought to; investigate the proportion of mothers delivering in the health facility, determine socio-demographics factors that influences mother’s choice of place of delivery, examine the maternal factors that influence mothers’ choice of place of delivery, establish the cultural factors that influence mothers' choice of place of delivery and to analyze health facility factors that influences mother’s choice of place of delivery in Heliwa District. A descriptive cross-sectional study design was used. It involved collecting information using quantitative measures with key informants and interviewee schedules respectively from a sample of 402 respondents were determined using a standard formula of Keish and Leslie. The findings of the study were that there was a strong association between age of women, number of children they have and the number of household members. This is in agreement with observations in other studies for they showed that healthcare services utilization had a strong statistical association with the age of women, number of children they have and the number of household members. The findings revealed that cultural practices had great influence of mothers choice in place of delivery since more than 50% of respondents said that there are some things done by TBA and home that are good but not done in the health facility. The association between the cultural practices and choice of place of delivery was strong (X2 = 0.012, P-value=0.913). Of the 380 respondents, only 19(5%) believes that health workers have a good attitude, of these 4(3.2%) delivered from the health facility. There is strong association between attitude of health workers towards clients and their choice of place of delivery(X2 -26.21, P-value <\0.0001). </p>
                                        <p>
                                        The study concluded that study concludes that hospital delivery is increasing with time in Heliwa District, Somalia. This is a clear indication that today women are more aware of the need for safe and secure place of delivery where skilled birth attendants are available and in case of emergencies, medical intervention is offered in good time. The study recommends that their involvement of husbands as key decision makers in the choice of place of delivery during antenatal clinic visits should be one of the best strategies in reduction of home deliveries. The government should focus more on women empowerment through creating entrepreneurship opportunities for them as a measure to make them financially stable and this could of a positive impact on the choices they make during delivery. <hr>
